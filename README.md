# ABOUT ME
	*Hi guys, I am Sourabh Santosh Kamble and I am an engineering Student at K.S. Institute of Technology.

	*The repository consists of 12 programs.
	
	* First 9 programs are stored in folders Program 1 to Program 9.
	
	* Program 10,11 and 12 are stored in folders Program X,Program XI and Program XII.
	
	* The Problem Statement of the reffered program is specified in the file Question.md.
	
	* The programs I have uploaded are tested in the terminal (in ubuntu).
	
	* These programs can be executed on various IDE platforms like Eclipse,Code blocks 
	but I personally recommend you guys to  use the terminal(if linux) or 
	command Prompt(If windows) .
	
	* The sample output of the programs are also uploaded so that the user gets an idea 
	of how the output is suppose to be.
	
	* Also the additional files that are created when the .java file is saved(Eg. Prog1.class) 
	are also been uploaded.
