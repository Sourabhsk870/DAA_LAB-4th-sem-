# ABOUT ME
	*Hi guys, I am Sourabh Santosh Kamble and I am an engineering Student at K.S. Institute of Technolgy.
	*I have created this repository so that any student of 4th sem who is affiliated to vtu 
	under the 2018 CBCS scheme can view this lab programs as a refrence.
	
# ABOUT THE REPOSITORY
	* The programs I have uploaded are tested in the terminal of ubuntu.
	* These programs can be executed on various IDE platforms like Eclipse,Code blocks 
	but I personally recommend you guys to  use the terminal(if linux) or command Prompt(If windows) .
	* The sample output of the programs are also uploaded so that the user gets an idea og how the output must be.
	* Also the additional files that are created when the .java file is saved(Eg. Prog1.class) are also been uploaded.
	* Hope you guys have fun while coding.
