# Program 5
	Sort a given set of n integer elements using MERGE SORT method and compute its time
	complexity. Run the program for varied values >5000, and record the time taken 
	to sort. Plot the graph of time taken versus n on graph sheet. The elements can be
	read from a file or can generate using random number generator. Demonstrate using 
	Java how divide and conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis:
		* Worst case
		* Best case
		* Average case.
