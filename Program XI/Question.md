# Program 11
	Design and implement in Java to find the subset of a given set S = {S1,S2,..
	,Sn} of n positive integers whose SUM is equal to a given positive integer
	d. For example if S ={1,2,5,6,8} and d = 9, there are two solutions {1,2,6}
	and {1,8}. Display a suitable message , if the given problem instance doesn't 
	have a solution.
